                    Alan Turing was a computer scientist at

                    throughout <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War Two</a>. He was born on 23<sup>rd</sup> June 1912, in

                    During World War Two, he worked at <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hut_8">Hut 8 </a> of Bletchley Park where he helped to improve a

        <h2>Early Life & Schooling</h2>
        <p class="main">
            Alan Turing was born in London, where he spent most of his early life and holidays after 
            enrolling in a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school">boarding school</a> at the age of 13. He presented a particular interest and 
            skill in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a> 
            at a young age, much to the dislike of many teachers at his boarding school, who focused more on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics">classical studies</a> 
            than subjects like science and Mathematics.<br><br>
            Between 1931 and 1934, Turing studied Mathematics as an undergraduate at <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge"> Cambridge's King's College</a>.
            He achieved a first-class honours in Mathematics, and went on to get a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">PhD</a> in mathematics at 
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>.

                    At Bletchley Park, Turing primarily worked on <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma">cryptanalysis of the Enigma</a> and cracking of the 
                    Enigma. He also produced the specification for the Bombe - a machine that searched for possible settings for the Enigma machine. This machine proved to be crucial in cracking 
                    the cipher, which led to the decryption on many messages detailing planned attacks from the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powersAxis">Axis Powers</a>, and 
                    the prevention of these attacks.

        <h2>Life Post WW2</h2>
        <p class="main">
            Post World War Two, Alan Turing worked on many projects, including proposing the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a> and working on the first videogame, 
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turochamp">Turochamp</a>.<br><br> Unfortunately, in March 1952 Turing was convicted of gross indecency due to being gay 
            (homosexual acts being illegal in the UK at the time). He was made to undergo hormonal changes, such as oestrogen injections, and he later committed suicide on 8<sup>th</sup> June 1954, 
            through a fatal dosage of cyanide.<br><br>On 24<sup>th</sup> December 2013, Turing was pardoned.
